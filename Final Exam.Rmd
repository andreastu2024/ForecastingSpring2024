#Summary of Import Data
-The first step before forecasting is to import the data. We can observe below that the data needs to be converted to times series in order to compare the different forecast methods.

#Plot and Inference
#Show a time series plot.
```{r}
sales_data = sales$Sales.Units
sales_ts = ts(sales_data, frequency = 12, start = c(2019, 1))
plot(sales_ts)
sales_win = window(sales_ts, frequency = 12, start = c(2022, 1))
plot(sales_win)
```

#Please summarize your observations of the time series plot
-In the graph above we can observe a cyclical event in the year of 2020. In order to forecast for the future months, we need to exclude all the data before 2020.

#Central Tendency
#What are the min, max, mean, median, 1st, and 3rd Quartile values of the times series?
```{r}
summary(sales_win)
```

#Show the box plot.
```{r}
boxplot(sales_win)
```

#Can you summarize your observation about the time series from the summary stats and box plot?
-In the summary results we can observe that the median is higher than the mean indicating the distribution is left skewed. In the box plot, we can observe there are no outliers and confirm its left skewed distribution.

#Decompostion
```{r}
stl_decom = stl(sales_win,s.window = "periodic")
plot(stl_decom)
```

#Is the time series seasonal?
```{r}
decomp = decompose(sales_win)
decomp
```

-Yes the time series is seasonal and can be observe in the decomposition results which includes seasonal, trend and random.

#Is the decomposition additive or multiplicative?
-The decomposition is additive. Implying that seasonal fluctuations are constant over time.

#If seasonal, what are the values of the seasonal monthly indices?
```{r}
decomp$figure
```

#For which month is the time series value high, and for which month is it low?
-The month with the lowest value in the time series is December and the one with the highest value is April.

#Can you think of the reason behind the high and low values in those months?
-In the month of December, usually families prefer to stay at home due to the cold weather. Also as the holidays approaches families gather together at home and tend to go out less lowering the car's sales. Meanwhile, in the month of April is where the warm weather starts and families go out more often, therefore increasing the need of a car.

#Show the plot for time series adjusted for seasonality. Overlay this with the line fluctuals? Does seasonality have big fluctuations in the value of time series?
```{r}
seasadj(stl_decom)
plot(sales_win)
stl_decom = stl(sales_win,s.window = "periodic")
lines(seasadj(stl_decom), col="red")
```

-The seasonality has some fluctuations over the value of the time series. For example, mid 2022 the value of the time series is increasing while the seasonality value is constant with no peaks in demand.

```

#Perform Residual Analysis for this technique.
#Do a plot of residuals. What does the plot indicate?
```{r}
attributes(naive_sales)
plot(naive_sales$residuals)
```

-After plotting the residuals of the naive forecast we can observe there is some pattern in the plot. Ideally, the residual plot should have a random residual plot.

#Do a Histogram plot of residuals. What does the plot indicate?
```{r}
hist(naive_sales$residuals)
```

-After plotting the residuals of the naive forecast, the histogram seems to be normally distributed.

ggplot(plot_naive, aes(x=fitted, y=residuals))+geom_point()
```

-Ideally the scatter plot between the fitted and residuals should not have any patterns. The fitted values should have zero effect on the residual values. However this plot shows that the fitted values have effect on the residual values.

#Do a plot of actual values vs. residuals. What does the plot indicate?
```{r}
ggplot(plot_naive, aes(x=actual, y=residuals))+geom_point()

#What is the value of the initial state?

-14.5655 

#What is the value of sigma? What does the sigma signify?

-The value of sigma is 0.5893. The higher the value of sigma the more variability and the less reliable the forecast it is. A lower value indicated the forecast errors tend to be smaller. In this case, it can be considered as moderate variability.

#Separately define each forecast method and why it is useful. Show the best and worst forecast method for each of the accuracy measures.

Naive:
-The naive method will take the previous data to forecast the next value and assumes no trend, seasonality or any fluctuations.Naive is very simple to forecast and could be the baseline to compare to other methods.
Exponential Smoothing:
-The exponential smoothing calculates the next forecast value as a weighted average of the actual value. With the weighted average it give more weight to more recent data and ca be beneficial when the analysis has trend data.
Holt-Winters:
-The Holt-Winter method could be apply when the data has level, trend and seasonality. Also, holt-winters can be use for additive and multiplicative forecasts.

#Conclusion
#Summarize your analysis of time series value over the time period.

-After performing the forecast above, we can conclude SARIMA performs better than the other methods.
-SARIMA has the lowest accuracy results.

#Based on your analysis and forecast above, do you think the value of the time series will increase, decrease, or stay flat over the next year? How about the next 2 years?

-I think the sales for the next and two years will remaining constant with some increases and decreases in sales in some months.
